    <div class="text">

	<p><span class="pre">if</span> and <span class="pre">match</span> are control structures
	that determine which code block to perform based on the evaluated result of one or more conditional expressions.</p>
	
	<h2>if vs. match</h2>
	<p>Let's use a simple number comparison to illustrate how 
	<span class="pre">if</span> and <span class="pre">match</span> work.
	<h3>if</h3>
	<p>In this heavily commented example, the code block to perform is determined
	by comparing a combined roll of two die with 7:</p>
<pre>
// Is roll equal to 7?
if roll == 7
  // If so, assign result to "Perfect"
  result = "Perfect"
// Otherwise ("else if"), is roll less than 7?
elif roll &lt; 7
  // If so, assign result to "Too low!"
  result = "Too low!"
// Otherwise (since the roll is not 7 nor less than 7)
else
  // Assign result to "Too high!"
  result = "Too high!"
</pre>
	<p>Every <span class="pre">if</span> structure follows these rules:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>It begins with <span class="pre">if</span> followed by a
	<a href="#condexp">conditional expression</a> and then a block of statements.
	In this example, <span class="pre">roll == 7</span> is the conditional expression.
	A block may hold one or more multiple statements.</li>
	<li>Any number of <span class="pre">elif</span> structures may follow (including none).
	Each specifies its own conditional expression and a block of statements.</li>
	<li>If specified, a single <span class="pre">else</span> structure comes last.
	It has no conditional expression; only a block of statements.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Since <span class="pre">if</span> may be used as an expression, the above code can be simplified to:</p>
<pre>
result = if roll == 7
  "Perfect"
elif roll &lt; 7
  "Too low!"
else
  "Too high!"
</pre>
	<p>If a block has multiple statements, the expression in the last statement of the block
	is used as the value of that block.</p>
	<p>The above example can also be written on a single line:</p>
<pre>
result = if roll == 7 {"Perfect"} elif roll&lt;7 {"Too low!"} else {"Too high!"}
</pre>

	<h4>if clause</h4>
	<p>When an <span class="pre">if</span> structure has only a single block containing only a single
	line, this can be expressed on a single line by following the statement with an
	<span class="pre">if</span> clause:</p>
<pre>
bignumber = true if nbr &gt; 100
</pre>
	<p>That line is exactly equivalent to:</p>
<pre>
if nbr &gt; 100
  bignumber = true
</pre>

	<h3>match</h3>
	
	
	<h2 id="condexp">Conditional Expressions</h2>
	<p>A wide variety of conditional expressions can be formulated, from simple equivalence or comparisons
	to complex algorithms that use logical operators, pattern matching, functions or type-specific methods.		<p>Note: Evaluation operators have lower precedence than arithmetic operators, but higher than assignment.</p>

		<h3>Equivalence Operators</h3>
		<p>The '==' operator returns true if two values have the same content and type.
		'!=' (not equal) is true if they do not. For example:</p>
<pre>
x == 3.0        # Returns true if the local variable x's value is 3.0
x+1 != y        # Returns true if x is not exactly 1 greater than y
2 == 2.0        # Returns false, because the Integer vs. Float types do not match
true != false   # Returns true
</pre>
		<p>The equality check is not always exact or rapid, depending on the value's type.
		Since floating point calculations are imprecise and can introduce "rounding errors", 
		two Float values will be declared "equal" if they are sufficiently close.
		Large, complex value types, such as lists, can take time, as it requires
		comparing every element in the list for equivalence.</p>
		<p>The '===' operator offers a rapid way to determine if two values are literally the same value.
		Two floats would have to match exactly, with no margin for calculation error. 
		Two List or Text values would have to point to the same List or Text value, 
		as a copy made of a list would not be exactly equal using the '===' operator.</p>

		<h3>Comparison Operators</h3>
		<p>Comparison operators determine whether one value is greater
		or less than some other value. They only work well on value types that
		are comparable (such as Integer, Float and Text).</p>
<pre>
x &gt;= 2          # Returns true if x is greater than or equal to 2 (&gt;, &lt;, &lt;= are variants)
2 &lt;= 2.0        # Returns false any time the types do not agree
</pre>
		<p>Float values are compared using the same closeness criteria described above.
		For one Float value to be less than another, it must be less by at least the comparable closeness.</p>
		<p>All comparison operators use the '&lt;=&gt;' method to perform the comparison.
		It returns an Integer (rather than true or false): -1 if less, 0 if equal, and 1 if greater.
		It returns 'null' if two values are not comparable.
		Any Type that implements this method becomes comparable:</p>
<pre>
# Make frosty comparable to other values
frosty
	# Comparison returns 1, as frosty is always the greatest!
	'&lt;=&gt;': [x]
		1

frosty &gt; Float.Infinity  # true
</pre>
		<p>The rocket-ship operator can be used directly:</p>
<pre>
-2 <=> 4      # Returns -1
</pre>
		<h3>Pattern Matching Operator</h3>
		<p>The '~~' pattern match operator determines whether a specific value matches a particular pattern.
		A pattern is any value that can responds to the '~~' method with a non-null value.
		Thus, all sorts of pattern-matchers can be built, such as set membership, types used,
		regular expression, search selectors (e.g., for parts), parsers, input decoders, 
		translaters, information analysis, etc.</p>
		<p>These examples use a Range as a pattern.</p>
<pre>
5 ~~ 1 .. 7   # Returns true, since 5 is within the range between 1 and 7
</pre>
		<p>Some important notes about pattern matching:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>The match operator '~~' is the only ones that applies the implied method ('~~')
		to the right hand value (the pattern) rather than the left. 
		Thus, <span class="pre">a~~b</span> is implemented as: 
		<span class="pre">b.'~~'(a)</span>.
		This exception makes the code easier to read and mirrors the order on the 'match' statement, 
		while still putting the matching work on the pattern, where it belongs.</li>
		<li>A pattern match always returns false on a failed match.
		A successful match may return true, or (more interestingly) it may return
		a value calculated as a result of the match. 
		For example, matching text to a regular expression might return a list containing extracted text segments
		that matched certain numbered slots.</li>
		<li>When a type does not implement the '~~' method, 
		the Any Type ensures that the '==' method will be used in its place.
		Thus two equal values will always match.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Evaluation Methods</h3>
		<p>Beyond the evaluation operators listed above, there are many type-specific methods which can
		be used to evaluate values. 
		This is particularly true for any method whose name ends with a question-mark 
		(indicating it returns a true or false value). For example:</p>
<pre>
list.empty?   # Returns true if list has no members, false otherwise
</pre>
	
	<h2>Conditional Expressions</h2>
	<p>A conditional expression evaluates to some value whose "truth" is used to determine
	the sequence of statement execution for a control block or clause. 
	Such expressions are considered false if its evaluated value is either 
	<span class="pre">false</span> or <span class="pre">null</span>.
	Any other value of any type, including 
	<span class="pre">true</span>, <span class="pre">0</span> and <span class="pre">""</span>
	will be considered true.</p>
	<p>A conditional expression can be as simple as a single literal or variable value.
	More commonly, it involves the use of one of the evaluation operators or methods described above. 
	The boolean operators described below can be used to logically transform multiple evaluations
	into a single value that is considered true or false for control flow purposes.</p>

		<h3>Boolean Operators</h3>
		<p>Acorn has three boolean operators:  
		and ('&&'), or ('||') and not ('!'). One can use either the word or the symbol. 
		For example:</p>
<pre>
0==3 or not 2&lt;3 and 3==3   # Returns true ('and' is evaluated before 'or')
0==3 || !2&lt;3 && 3==3       # equivalent to above
</pre>
		<p>The logical operators work mostly how you would expect:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>As mentioned earlier, they treat null and false as false. All other values are considered true.</li>
		<li>The boolean operators && and || will stop evaluating any time the answer is known for sure.
		Thus, the .empty? method will never be performed in this expression (making it similar to a simple 'if' statement):
<pre>
false and list.empty?
</pre>
		</li>
		<li>Although ! only returns a value of either true or false, || and && simply returns the
		last value checked (which could be a non-Bool value). For example:
<pre>
val1 = null
val2 = 4.5
val = val1 || val2    # val is now 4.5
</pre>
		</li>
		<li>The logical operators have a lower precedence than evaluation operators, but higher than assignment.
		! has the highest precedence, then &&, then ||. </li>
		</ul>

		<p><b>Note:</b> 
		In case it is not obvious by now, these boolean operators are not the same
		as the boolean bit-arithmetic operators found in other languages. 
		There should not be much need for them in Acorn,
		but they are provided as Integer methods (.not, .and, .or, .xor, .shl, .shr) if they are needed.</p>

		<p><b>Note 2:</b>
		If a comparison operator or boolean operator is used outside the context of a control structure
		that wants a conditional expression (e.g., if), in most cases it will evaluate to a value of 'true' or 'false'.
		If the conditional expression just uses 'and' or 'or' operators, its value will be the
		last value evaluated in that expression.</p>
